## Lerd, a local PHP development environment

This project runs on **lerd**, a Podman-based PHP development environment. It is framework-agnostic: Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, Drupal, Magento, CakePHP and any custom framework are all driven by a framework definition (YAML), never by lerd hardcoding a framework's name. The `lerd` MCP server is available — use it to manage the environment without leaving the chat.

The MCP surface is **twelve grouped tools**, each driven by an `action` argument: `site`, `service`, `db`, `env`, `runtime`, `worker`, `exec`, `framework`, `diag`, `logs`, `worktree`, `workspace`. Always pass `action`. Most actions also accept an optional `path` that defaults to the directory the assistant was opened in (then `LERD_SITE_PATH` if set), so you can usually omit it. Start by calling `site` with `action: "list"` to discover sites.

### Architecture

- PHP runs in Podman containers named `lerd-php<version>-fpm` (e.g. `lerd-php84-fpm`); each container includes composer and node/npm; the PHP version is resolved from `.lerd.yaml` → `.php-version` → `composer.json` `require.php` constraint (matched against installed versions) → global default
- Nginx routes `*.test` domains to the correct PHP-FPM container
- Services (MySQL, Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.) and custom services run as Podman containers via systemd quadlets
- Node.js versions run through a version manager, fnm (bundled, fetched on demand) or user nvm (declining managed Node picks nvm; `node.manager` + `node.nvm_dir`; `node:manager`/dashboard; nvm keeps PATH, fnm uses shims); per-project version via a `.node-version` file. The **package manager** is the project's, not lerd's: a `packageManager` pin in `package.json` wins, then the lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `bun.lock*` → bun, else npm). pnpm and yarn run through corepack, and installs use the manager's frozen-lockfile mode (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `yarn install --immutable`, `npm ci`). Never assume `npm run dev`/`npm ci` — the worker command and the setup steps follow the detected manager
- Framework workers (queue, schedule, reverb, horizon, messenger, vite, etc.) run as systemd user services named `lerd-<worker>-<sitename>`; commands are defined per-framework in YAML; Laravel Horizon is auto-detected from `composer.json` and replaces the queue toggle when installed; Laravel ships with a `vite` host worker that runs the project's dev script on the host for HMR, through whichever package manager the project pins; workers and setup commands support optional `check` (`file` or `composer`) for conditional visibility; workers with `conflicts_with` auto-stop conflicting workers on start. Per-worker flags: `host: true` (run on host via the version manager instead of in FPM container — HMR-sensitive Node tools), `per_worktree: true` (worker runs independently per worktree under `lerd-<worker>-<site>-<branch>`), `replaces_build: true` (worker provides asset manifest while running, so a worktree add skips the static `npm run build` step when this worker is opted in)
- Custom workers can be added per-project (`.lerd.yaml` `custom_workers`) or globally (`~/.config/lerd/frameworks/<name>.yaml`); use the `worker` tool's `add`/`remove` actions — both survive framework store updates
- Framework setup commands (one-off bootstrap steps like migrations, storage links) are defined in the framework YAML and shown by `framework` `action: "setup"`; Laravel has built-in storage:link/migrate/db:seed; custom frameworks can define their own
- Service version placeholders (`{{mysql_version}}`, `{{postgres_version}}`, `{{redis_version}}`, `{{meilisearch_version}}`) are available in framework env vars and resolved from the service image tag at env-setup time
- **Custom containers**: non-PHP sites (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.) can define a `Containerfile.lerd` and a `container:` section in `.lerd.yaml` with a port; lerd builds a per-project image, runs it as `lerd-custom-<sitename>`, and nginx reverse-proxies to it; the project directory is volume-mounted at its host path with `--workdir` set automatically — do NOT add `WORKDIR` or `COPY` to the Containerfile; workers exec into the custom container; services are accessible by name on the shared `lerd` Podman network; **hot-reload file watchers must use polling on macOS** (inotify does not fire across Podman Machine's virtiofs mount) — nodemon: `--legacy-watch`, Vite: `server.watch.usePolling: true`, webpack: `watchOptions: { poll: 1000 }`
- **Custom-image PHP sites (custom-FPM)**: a PHP project can define a `Containerfile.lerd` (must build `FROM lerd-php<ver>-fpm:local`) plus a `container:` section with **no port**; lerd builds a per-site image (`lerd-custom-<site>:local`), runs a dedicated FPM container `lerd-cfpm-<site>`, and serves it by fastcgi instead of the shared `lerd-php<ver>-fpm`. It is a normal PHP site otherwise (xdebug, dumps, profiler, `lerd shell`, `php`/`artisan`/`composer`/`tinker`, queue/horizon all run in the per-site container). The PHP version is fixed by the `FROM` line (the UI version selector is read-only); `lerd rebuild` rebuilds the image. Same key as custom containers, the port is the discriminator: with a port it is a reverse-proxied non-PHP app, without a port it is a fastcgi PHP image. `runtime` for these reports `fpm-custom`.
- Git worktrees automatically get a `<branch>.<site>.test` subdomain (deep `*.<branch>.<site>.test` wildcard cert + nginx `server_name` on secured sites); `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `.env` are seeded from the main checkout. `.lerd.yaml` `env_overrides` declares templated env vars (`{{domain}}`, `{{scheme}}`, `{{site}}`) layered on the default `APP_URL` rewrite — for multi-tenant apps (per-branch cookies, signed-URL hosts, tenant routing)

### DNS modes

Lerd has two install-time DNS modes recorded in `~/.config/lerd/config.yaml`:
- **Managed (default)**: `dns.enabled: true`, `dns.tld: test`. Sites at `*.test` via lerd-dns + mkcert; `site` `tls_enable` works.
- **Disabled**: `dns.enabled: false`, `dns.tld: localhost`. Sites at `*.localhost` via RFC 6761; no mkcert CA, TLS toggling unavailable.

Read `diag` `action: "status"` for `dns.tld` and `dns.enabled` instead of assuming `.test`; do not propose `tls_enable` when `dns.enabled` is false.

### MCP tools

Twelve grouped tools, each selecting behaviour via `action`.

#### `site` — sites and their configuration
Actions: `list` (discover sites — CALL FIRST), `link`, `unlink`, `domain_add`, `domain_remove`, `group_assign`, `group_unassign`, `group_label`, `group_db`, `group_list`, `tls_enable`, `tls_disable`, `tls_renew`, `php`, `node`, `pause`, `unpause`, `restart`, `rebuild`, `runtime`, `nginx_read`, `nginx_write`, `nginx_reset`, `park`, `unpark`.
- `link` registers a directory; non-PHP sites need `.lerd.yaml` `container.port` + a Containerfile first, or they register as PHP (wrong)
- `link` runs `lerd link` and returns its output verbatim, so read the reply. It will NOT start a `proxy.command` dev server (`command not approved`); ask the user to run `lerd link --yes`
- `domain_*` take a domain without the `.test` TLD; you can't remove the last domain
- `group_*` nest a secondary site under a main's subdomain (one level deep): they identify the secondary by `path` (defaults to cwd), not by `site`; `group_assign` with `main` + `label` (+ optional `share_db`), `group_db` = share|separate
- a group secondary follows its main's HTTPS: `group_assign` under a secured main secures the secondary, `tls_enable` on a main secures its secondaries too, and `tls_disable` on a secondary is refused while its main is secured (the main's `*.<main>` wildcard would answer the subdomain and serve the main's app). Disable the main's TLS first
- certificates renew themselves before they expire; `tls_renew` forces it by hand for one site
- `php`/`node` take `version`; pass `branch` to pin the override on a worktree's checkout
- `runtime` switches `fpm` ↔ `frankenphp` (`worker: true` enables frankenphp worker mode)
- `nginx_write` saves a custom override (runs `nginx -t`, backs up, reloads); `branch` targets a worktree
- `park` registers a parent dir and auto-registers every PHP project under it; `unpark` reverses it (project files kept)

#### `service` — built-in & custom services
Actions: `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `pin`, `unpin`, `update`, `rollback`, `migrate`, `remove`, `reinstall`, `add`, `expose`, `port`, `env`, `config_read`, `config_write`, `config_restore`, `config_reset`, `config_list_backups`, `preset_list`, `preset_search`, `preset_install`, `check_updates`, `entities`, `entity_action`.
- `update` pulls a newer image (safe, in-strategy); `migrate` dumps + restores across a cross-strategy upgrade; `reinstall` with `reset_data: true` wipes data and reprovisions; `remove` with `remove_data: true` renames the data dir aside
- `stop` marks the service paused — `lerd start` skips it until started again; `pin` keeps it always running
- `add` registers a custom OCI service (`depends_on` wires dependencies, `init: true` for mysql/mariadb); prefer `preset_install` for anything in `preset_list` (phpmyadmin, pgadmin, mongo, mongo-express, selenium, stripe-mock, mysql, mariadb…)
- `preset_list` returns the installable presets with the metadata each one declares: `category` (the discovery heading), `icon`, and `admin_for` — the services this preset's admin UI administers, which is **not** `depends_on`. phpMyAdmin depends on mysql but administers mariadb too, and RedisInsight administers valkey without depending on it. To answer "which dashboard administers this database", read `admin_for`, not `depends_on`. `preset_search` queries the store by `name` for presets that are not bundled locally
- `env` returns the recommended `.env` connection keys; `expose` publishes an extra `host:container` port
- `port` moves the service's primary published host port (`published_port`, or `reset: true` for the default); it stays bound to 127.0.0.1, the container-internal port is unchanged, and a host-proxy site that points at the old port is realigned automatically
- `entities` lists what a service holds that is not a database: the kinds its preset declares (RustFS buckets today, more later), each kind's rows and the actions it supports. Databases have their own tool, so they are not repeated here. `entity_action` runs one of those declared actions (`kind`, `entity`, `entity_action`); export and import stream a file and stay on the CLI and the dashboard
- `config_*` read/write/restore/reset a service's runtime tuning override

#### `db` — databases
Actions: `list`, `set`, `move`, `create`, `export`, `import`, `snapshot`, `snapshots`, `restore`, `snapshot_delete`, `extension_list`, `extension_add`.
- `list` reports an engine's databases with sizes; `service` picks the engine, else it resolves from the project. No introspect command, nothing to report
- `set` picks the project DB (`database`: sqlite, mysql, postgres, or a family alternate like mariadb / postgres-pgvector / postgres-timescaledb / mysql-5-7); persists to `.lerd.yaml`, rewrites `DB_` keys, starts the service, creates the DB + `_testing`
- `move` migrates sites between two installed same-family services (`from`/`to`, `sites: [...]` or `all: true`) and repoints each `.env`; source data is left intact
- `create`/`export`/`import` auto-detect service and database; pass `service` to override. `import` drops a hosted provider's ownership/DEFINER statements (which can never apply here) and creates any extension the dump's types need; pass `fresh: true` to empty the database first so a dump replaces what is there instead of colliding with it. What an engine can list and act on is declared in its preset, so this is not a mysql/postgres-only set
- `extension_list`/`extension_add` are postgres-only. An `import` already creates whatever extension the dump's types reach for, so use these to see what the engine offers and what the database has, or to add one (`extension: postgis`) before any dump arrives
- `snapshot`/`snapshots`/`restore`/`snapshot_delete` are named, restorable snapshots (MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL); `restore` is destructive; `all_databases` covers the whole service

#### `env` — .env management
Actions: `setup`, `check`, `override`.
- `setup` configures services, DBs, APP_KEY and APP_URL; on a fresh Laravel clone call `db` `set` first to move off sqlite, then `env setup`, then ALWAYS `framework setup` or migrations never run
- `check` compares `.env` against `.env.example`
- `override` manages the personal, gitignored `.env.lerd_override` (its `set` KEY=VALUE win over lerd defaults; `LERD_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=<svc,svc>` marks vars lerd writes but won't start)

#### `runtime` — PHP/Node versions & extensions
Actions: `versions`, `node_install`, `node_uninstall`, `node_manager`, `php_list`, `ext_list`, `ext_add`, `ext_remove`, `ports_list`, `ports_add`, `ports_remove`, `ini_read`, `ini_write`, `ini_reset`.
- `ext_add`/`ext_remove` change one declared set applying to EVERY PHP version, so a site keeps its extensions across a version change. They rebuild one version's FPM container now (slow); others rebuild on next use. `ext_add` accepts `apk_deps` for extra Alpine build packages
- `ext_list` reports the declared set plus, per version: has it, predates the set (rebuild fixes), or cannot load it (rebuild won't). Never assume a declared ext is present: `mongodb` needs 8.1+, 7.4/8.0 are Alpine 3.16
- `node_manager` with no argument reports the version manager lerd drives, whether nvm is present and whether lerd manages Node at all; with `manager: fnm|nvm` it switches, which also rewrites the PATH shims and regenerates host workers
- `php_list` sets `base_update` when the published base image a version was built from has been republished (an upstream PHP or Alpine fix); `lerd php:rebuild <version>` picks it up
- `ports_add`/`ports_remove`/`ports_list` publish extra host ports on a PHP version's shell (FPM) container so a process started in `lerd shell` is reachable at `localhost:PORT`. `ports_add` takes `host` and optional `container` (defaults to `host`); a busy host port shifts to the next free one. Per version and independent, loopback-bound (follows `lan:expose`), restarts that version's FPM. Prefer host-proxy or a worker+proxy for a single site. CLI: `lerd php:ports add/remove/list [--php version]`
- `ini_read`/`ini_write`/`ini_reset` edit php.ini: pass `version` for a per-version file, or `shared: true` for the shared file applied to every version. The shared file loads below the per-version one, so a per-version key still wins and an unknown key on some version is ignored (not fatal). Prefer shared for a setting you want everywhere, so a version change never drops it. `ini_write` takes full `content`, backs up, and restarts the affected FPM containers. CLI: `lerd php:ini [version|shared]`
- **extra Alpine packages**: `lerd php:pkg add/remove/list <packages>` (CLI) bakes runtime apk packages (CLI tools, libs) into every FPM image, saved in config under `php.packages` and re-applied on every rebuild, so they survive `php:rebuild` and base image updates. One declared set applies to every PHP version. Layered onto the shared image, not the published base.
- **Pest browser testing (CLI-only)**: `lerd pest:browser install|doctor|remove [version]` sets up `pestphp/pest-plugin-browser` inside the FPM container by baking Alpine's musl chromium into the images. Chromium only, and current PHP versions only (the 7.4/8.0 legacy tier is rejected). Needs the `playwright` npm package first; re-run install after bumping it. Tests then run through the normal `lerd test`/`lerd pest`.
- **bun**: lerd never installs or version-manages bun. On the host, JS install/dev/build run through bun when the project is a bun project (`bun.lockb`/`bun.lock`/`bunfig.toml`/`packageManager: bun`) or when Node is unmanaged, no system Node exists, and bun is present. CLI-only: `lerd node:manage`/`node:unmanage` opt in or out of lerd-managed Node (unmanage drops fnm versions, never a user's nvm ones), `lerd js:runtime [bun|node|auto]` pins one site's runtime, and `lerd php:bun install|update|version` manages an in-container bun for `lerd shell`. These are host operations, not container exec actions.

#### `worker` — background workers
Actions: `list` (CALL FIRST), `start`, `stop`, `add`, `remove`, `health`, `heal`, `mode_get`, `mode_set`, and the framework workers `queue_start`, `queue_stop`, `horizon_start`, `horizon_stop`, `reverb_start`, `reverb_stop`, `schedule_start`, `schedule_stop`, `stripe_start`, `stripe_stop`, `stripe_config`.
- call `list` to discover a site's workers before `start`; pass `branch` to target a per-worktree unit
- use `horizon_*` instead of `queue_*` when laravel/horizon is installed (mutually exclusive); `queue_start` needs Redis running when `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis`
- `add` saves a custom worker to `.lerd.yaml` (or the user overlay with `global: true`); does not auto-start
- `health` reports unhealthy units (read-only); `heal` resets and restarts them (`unit` for one, omit for all); `mode_get` reports the macOS worker runtime, `mode_set` switches it (`mode`: exec|container)
- a worker's health `state` is one of `failed` (the unit died), `expected-but-stopped` (it should be running and isn't), or `unreachable` — the unit is happily active but the server it publishes no longer accepts connections, a dev server that wedged without exiting. All three are heal-able; `heal` restarts the unit. Per-worktree units (`lerd-<worker>-<site>-<branch>`) are covered by the same pass, so a dead per-worktree Vite heals like any other. A worker with a `schedule` is a oneshot driven by a timer and is idle between ticks by design, which is healthy
- Stripe secret is read from `.env` (STRIPE_SECRET / STRIPE_SECRET_KEY / STRIPE_API_KEY); `stripe_config` sets webhook_path / secret_env_key in `.lerd.yaml`
- **Auto-reload (CLI-only)**: `lerd horizon:reload [on|off]` and `lerd octane:reload [on|off]` (FrankenPHP worker mode) restart workers on file changes; both need the project's `chokidar` npm package
- **Idle-suspend (CLI-only)**: `lerd idle on/off` toggles activity-driven suspension globally; suspended workers stop after the idle timeout (`lerd idle timeout <dur>`) and resume on the next request/CLI/MCP/file-save. `lerd idle pin/unpin <site>` exempts a site; `lerd idle status` reports policy and last-active. A worker shown as suspended is healthy, not failed, so do not `heal` it

#### `exec` — run tooling in the PHP-FPM container
Actions: `artisan` (Laravel), `console` (other frameworks), `composer`, `vendor_bins`, `vendor_run`, `commands_list`, `commands_run`, `command_add`, `command_remove`.
- `artisan`/`console`/`composer` take `args` (array); tinker must use `--execute=<code>` for non-interactive use
- `vendor_run` is the right way to run project tooling (pest, phpunit, pint, phpstan, rector) — call `vendor_bins` first to discover what's installed, then `vendor_run` with `bin` + `args`; prefer it over `composer exec`
- `commands_*`/`command_*` list, run, add and remove the on-demand commands in a site's `.lerd.yaml` `commands:` block; `commands_run` needs `force: true` for confirm-gated commands
- **composer over git SSH (CLI-only)**: when `composer` needs a private repo reachable only over SSH, `lerd auth ssh` starts a shared ssh-agent container and loads the host's `~/.ssh/id_*` (or named keys) so passphrase-protected keys work in the FPM container; `lerd auth ssh --list` shows loaded keys, `--remove` flushes them. Keys live only in agent memory and clear on machine restart

#### `framework` — framework definitions & scaffolding
Actions: `list`, `add`, `remove`, `prune`, `search`, `update`, `project_new`, `setup`.
- `add` with `name: "laravel"` merges custom workers/setup into the built-in framework
- `remove` refuses to drop a definition a linked site still uses (pass `force: true` to override); `prune` removes every framework definition no site uses
- `search`/`update` use the community store; definitions auto-fetch on link, so `update` is the manual refresh (no `name` refreshes the catalogue and all installed definitions; with `name` it fetches that one, auto-detecting version from `composer.lock`)
- `project_new` scaffolds a new project (requires absolute `path`, default framework laravel); follow with `site` `link` + `env` `setup`
- `setup` runs the framework's post-install steps (migrations, storage:link…) — MANDATORY after `env setup` on new/cloned projects; idempotent

#### `diag` — diagnostics & observability
Actions: `status`, `doctor`, `doctor_fix`, `site_doctor`, `which`, `check`, `dns_diagnose`, `bug_report`, `analyze_queries`, `route_timing`, `optimize_route`, `dumps_recent`, `dumps_status`, `dumps_clear`, `dumps_toggle`, `profiler_toggle`, `profiler_status`, `profiler_clear`, `profiler_report`, `xdebug_on`, `xdebug_off`, `xdebug_status`.
- `status` (DNS/nginx/FPM/watcher/tools health) and `doctor` (JSON findings, each tagged with a fix tier) are the first stops when something is broken; `dns_diagnose` walks the DNS chain
- `doctor_fix` applies the safe (non-heavy, non-sudo) automatic repairs for environment findings; package installs, `lerd install`, and `lerd cleanup` stay manual
- `site_doctor` runs framework-agnostic app-level checks for one site (env file, env drift, app key, composer/node dependency install + lock, `composer audit`/`npm audit`, PHP range, a `slow_routes` warning for routes whose p95 runs well above the site's typical time or over a second, plus the framework's own checks); pass `site` (name or domain) or `path`, defaults to cwd. A failing check carries a `severity` and, when one applies, a `fix` naming the command that resolves it — run that yourself (`exec`, or the named lerd command); site_doctor itself is read-only. `slow_routes` is the exception: it reads the watcher's request-timing snapshot and has no command fix, the remedy is to profile the route (`profiler_toggle`)
- reading logs lives in the `logs` tool (below), not here
- `which` shows resolved PHP/Node/docroot/nginx for a site; `check` validates `.lerd.yaml`
- debug bridge loop: `dumps_toggle` (enable) → `dumps_clear` → hit the page → `analyze_queries` (N+1 / slow-query report with file:line) or `dumps_recent` (filter by site/branch/ctx/kind/since/limit)
- `route_timing` returns the per-site response-time table: the typical (median) time and the routes whose p95 runs well above it (method, example path, p95, multiplier, samples), read from the watcher's request-timing snapshot. Works from recorded traffic alone, no capture needed. `site` accepts either the site name or its domain, as do `analyze_queries`, `optimize_route`, and `dumps_recent`
- `optimize_route` is the join: each slow route paired with the N+1 and slow-query findings captured against that same route (with the caller file:line), so you get the symptom and its cause in one call. Needs the query capture on (`dumps_toggle` enable) plus a few real hits. When the SPX profiler was on for the route's traffic, each slow route also carries a `profile` block, the top functions by exclusive wall time from the freshest capture, distilled to a few outliers (not the raw trace), so a CPU-bound route shows where its time went next to its queries
- **optimizing a slow site**: don't read controllers to guess at N+1s, drive it from real traffic. `route_timing` to see which routes are slow → `dumps_toggle` (enable) and `profiler_toggle` (enable) → hit the slow route a few times → `optimize_route` to get its N+1/slow queries with file:line and, from the profiler, the top CPU functions behind it → fix the caller (eager-load, index, cache) or the hot function
- **stay ahead of regressions**: when you change request handling or database code on a PHP site, verify you did not introduce a slowdown before moving on, enable dumps, hit the affected route, run `optimize_route`, and treat a new N+1 or a `slow_routes` doctor warning as work to finish rather than noise. On an unfamiliar site, `route_timing` shows the slow routes worth attention first. The timing panel is a live signal (recent traffic only, in memory), so a route you fixed clears once it stops being slow, but the durable catch is the `slow_route` push notification that fires the moment a route crosses into slow. Periodic checking belongs to the user's own scheduler (a routine, a cron job), not to lerd.
- `profiler_*` toggle the global SPX profiler and surface the flame-graph UI; `profiler_report` (site + `args`, e.g. `["artisan","app:heavy-report"]`) runs that command under SPX and returns a text flat profile, the top functions by wall time and call count, the CPU-bound analog of `analyze_queries` for when a slow route's cost is not in its queries (a reproducible CLI command, not a live HTTP request); `xdebug_*` control Xdebug on port 9003 (`mode` defaults to debug)
- `bug_report` writes an anonymised diagnostic report for a GitHub issue
- **disk cleanup (CLI-only)**: `lerd cleanup` reclaims podman disk from orphaned lerd images (`--dry-run` to preview, `--deep` for the aggressive tier); a daily safe-tier sweep plus post-rebuild/service-change reaping runs automatically, toggled with `lerd cleanup auto on|off|status`

#### `logs` — read logs from any source, filtered
Actions: `sources`, `fetch`. Debug without opening files by hand.
- `sources` lists every queryable source for the site plus shared infra: `app:<file>` (framework log files), `fpm`, `worker:<name>` (queue/horizon/schedule/custom), and the globals `nginx`, `dns`, `watcher`, `ui`, services, `php<ver>`. Call it first to learn the names
- `fetch source=<name>` reads one source. Filter with `grep` (regex, falls back to literal substring), `since`/`until` (relative like `15m`/`1h`/`2h30m`, or a timestamp), `level` (app logs only: error/warning/info/debug), and `lines` (default 50)
- streaming is polling: every `fetch` returns an opaque `cursor`; call again with `since=<cursor>` (or `cursor=<cursor>`) to get only the new lines. The cursor format differs per backend, so treat it as opaque and echo it back
- entries come back chronological (oldest first). Raw logs with no timestamps ignore `since`/`level` and just return the last N; a not-running container returns partial output, not an error

#### `worktree` — git worktrees
Actions: `list`, `add`, `remove`, `wait`, `db_isolate`, `db_share`.
- `add` installs deps and offers an asset-worker / build-step prompt; secured sites get `*.<branch>.<site>.test` wildcard cert SANs + nginx `server_name` automatically. It waits for setup and reports `provisioned` (`false` + note means still running, not failed; `timeout_seconds` default 300)
- `wait` is that readiness check alone, for a worktree made with plain `git worktree add`. **Never** judge readiness from the tree: `node_modules/` exists from the first extracted package and composer fills *existing* `vendor/<org>/` dirs, so both read as finished mid-install, and racing the watcher is how `vendor/` ends up with no `autoload.php`
- `db_isolate` gives a worktree its own database (seed via `source`: empty|main|<branch>); `db_share` points it back at the main; `remove` keeps an isolated DB unless `keep_db: false`
- a framework definition can declare what its worktrees need (an isolated database, what it is cloned from, console commands to run once it is in place), so `add` does that work rather than leaving it to be run by hand
- request timing is recorded per worktree; pass `branch` to `route_timing`, `optimize_route` and `dumps_recent` to read one branch's traffic

#### `workspace` — group sites for display
Actions: `list`, `create`, `rename`, `delete`, `assign`, `move`.
- a workspace is a **display-only** bucket of sites, shown in the dashboard sidebar and the TUI. It never touches nginx, domains, certificates or `.env`. This is not the same thing as the `site` tool's `group_*` actions, which nest a real site under another's subdomain and regenerate vhosts and certs — reach for `group_*` when a site should be served at `<label>.<main>.test`, and for `workspace` when the user just wants their site list organised
- `assign` takes `sites` (names or domains) and a `workspace`, creating it if new; `workspace: "none"` ungroups them. `move` reorders a workspace with a zero-based `position`
- `delete` drops the workspace and ungroups its members; no site is touched

### Key conventions

- Pass `action` on every tool; `path` is optional on most and defaults to the directory the assistant was opened in
- Discover before acting: `site` `list` for sites, `worker` `list` for a site's workers, `service` `preset_list` before `preset_install`, `exec` `vendor_bins` before `vendor_run`
- On a fresh Laravel clone (DB_CONNECTION=sqlite), call `db` `set` before `env` `setup` to choose a database deliberately, then run `framework` `setup`
- **Domain conflicts on link**: a link drops a domain another site owns (reported in `warnings`) and registers the survivors, falling back to `<dirname>.<tld>`; `.lerd.yaml` is untouched. `domain_add` still hard-errors
- **Custom APP_URL**: `env` `setup` writes `<scheme>://<primary-domain>`; override via `app_url` in `.lerd.yaml` (committed) or the per-machine `sites.yaml` entry, then re-run `env setup`
- Built-in service hosts follow `lerd-<name>` (e.g. `lerd-mysql`, `lerd-redis`, `lerd-postgres`); default DB credentials are username `root`, password `lerd`
- **Custom container sites** (Node.js, Python, Go, …) — mandatory order: (1) write a Containerfile (default `Containerfile.lerd`); (2) write `.lerd.yaml` with `container: {port: <N>}` (plus optional `domains`, `services`, `secured`); (3) configure the project's `.env` with service hosts (`lerd-mysql`, etc.) and start needed services via `service` `start`; (4) call `site` `link`. Never link before steps 1–3 or the site registers as PHP-FPM; if that happens, `site` `unlink`, write the files, then link again
- Worker unit names follow `lerd-<worker>-<site>` (per-worktree: `lerd-<worker>-<site>-<branch>`)
- **Host tools (CLI-only)**: `diag` `status` reports Composer, fnm and mkcert against the versions lerd pins, and flags any that differ. Applying an update is `lerd tools:update`, which has no tool here, so tell the user to run it rather than looking for an action
- **Sharing a site is CLI-only and deliberate**: `lerd share` (ngrok, cloudflared, Expose, serveo, localhost.run, Pinggy) and the dashboard's share menu put a site on the public internet, the same menu's public share serves it through the user's own reverse proxy on a base domain they control instead of a tunnel service, and `lerd lan:expose` puts it on the local network. None is exposed here, so never claim you can share a site; hand the user the command and let them decide

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== octane/core rules ===

# Laravel Octane

This application uses Laravel Octane, a long-running PHP server. The application bootstraps once and handles many requests within the same process.

- Never store request-specific state in singletons or static properties, because it can leak across requests.
- Use `config('octane.server')` to detect the active driver (`swoole`, `roadrunner`, or `frankenphp`).
- Prefer scoped bindings (`$this->app->scoped()`) over singletons for per-request services.

When working on Octane-specific features (concurrency, shared tables, memory, driver configuration, testing), invoke `octane-development` for detailed rules.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
